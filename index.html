                <h1>Missile Man of INDIA</h1>
                <hr>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the <i>11th</i> <b>president of India</b> from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <b>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</b> and <b>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the <i><b>Missile Man of India</b></i> for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
